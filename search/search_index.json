Annotations and naming conventions are also updated as new information about the function and structure  of genes becomes available.</p> <p>Genotype platforms, the methods or tool used to identify and detect genetic variations, can differ in their design and layout, which can affect the way genes are represented. This can lead to different probe IDs or other identifiers being used to refer to the  same genomic features on different platforms.</p> <p>Genomic feature identifiers can also differ between different species, since different  organisms have different sets of genes and thus different naming conventions for those  genes.

The database then finds any gene sets that  contain at least N of the genes in the provided list. From the resulting list of gene  sets, ABBA then isolates any genes that occur in at least M GeneSets but not in the  initial list.

These include empirical data obtained from public sources and their associated analytical tools, e.g. bulk analysis of gene co-expression to phenotypes across mouse strains from GeneNetwork.org, or QTL positional candidates from MGI. In contrast to Tier I in which the individual gene annotations to function are manually curated, Tier II includes machine generated gene annotations to functions from curated experimental data. GeneWeaver curators examine data and metadata. \ud83e\udd49Tier IIIHuman-Curated Data Tier III data are directly entered or reviewed by a professional curator for redundancy with existing records and adherence to documentation standards. Users who submit data under Tier IV have the option of sharing their data to the public. These data will be marked provisional until reviewed by the curator for data entry errors, compliance to metadata standards and redundancy with existing data. The submitter of the data will have the opportunity to approve the curators modifications to them prior to upgrade to Tier III status. For some research areas, a professional curator has identified and entered gene expression, quantitative trait locus and genomewide association studies (GWAS).
