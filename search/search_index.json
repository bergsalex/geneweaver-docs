These include empirical data obtained from public sources and their associated analytical tools, e.g. bulk analysis of gene co-expression to phenotypes across mouse strains from GeneNetwork.org, or QTL positional candidates from MGI. In contrast to Tier I in which the individual gene annotations to function are manually curated, Tier II includes machine generated gene annotations to functions from curated experimental data. GeneWeaver curators examine data and metadata. \ud83e\udd49Tier IIIHuman-Curated Data Tier III data are directly entered or reviewed by a professional curator for redundancy with existing records and adherence to documentation standards. Users who submit data under Tier IV have the option of sharing their data to the public. These data will be marked provisional until reviewed by the curator for data entry errors, compliance to metadata standards and redundancy with existing data. The submitter of the data will have the opportunity to approve the curators modifications to them prior to upgrade to Tier III status. For some research areas, a professional curator has identified and entered gene expression, quantitative trait locus and genomewide association studies (GWAS).
